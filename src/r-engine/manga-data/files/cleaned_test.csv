One devil in particular, Sword, has it in for a certain angel, Ios. In their 101st fight together, both are severely wounded. Not only that, but their clashing power causes the two to fall to earth. By chance, Sword finds a beaten, unconscious teenage boy nearby, and he is able to take over the human's body to save his own life.Some time later, Sword awakens in the hospital, briefly confused about his whereabouts. The father of the body he possessed enters the room, extremely happy to see his boy Souma alive. Then the older twin brother shows up. Immediately, Sword recognizes his enemy's energy. Also nearly dead, Ios had joined with Kanna's body. Sword goes to attack Ios, but quickly realizes that the body is far weaker than his demon form, especially from being recently beaten to hell.Since the brothers had been found heavily thrashed, their memory loss isn't that surprising. Their large change in behaviors is also explained by amnesia. As it turns out, Sword entered the body of the cliché nerd who can't run fifty meters without falling. Ios's new body is a terror, feared by all and constantly suspended from school. While the angel and devil have primary control over the bodies of the twins, reflex actions and memories of the other souls (still alive within the bodies) do appear. More importantly, the human bodies cannot handle the powers that Sword and Ios had used with ease. This a problem especially for Sword who is both over eager to use his powers and targeted by devils and angels.

Fu, an apparently young, skilful but cunning Taoist priest, re-animated Shue and used her as a zombie body guard... In order to acquire the method of full resurrection of Shue, Son became an apprentice of Fu and promised to help Fu with various unreasonable tasks. After that Son met different priests and necromancy practitioners, and he even visited the other sides of the world. Most of the stories are associated with Chinese necromancy and folklore and that is probably why it is called Necrolog.From MangaHelpers:One day, Son happened across a woman, named Shue, that he had loved as an older sister when they were young. It looked like it was the same woman, with the same scars, but Son had thought she was dead. In fact, she was a reanimated corpse, resurrected by a young girl named Fuu to work as her minion. Son becomes Fuu's follower, determined to find a way to return Shue's soul to her body so that she might live again. However, Son doesn't know what he's gotten into with Fuu, though, as she ends up in conflict with many other practitioners of her arts, using Shue's reanimated corpse to do things that Son would rather have never seen.

During the battles of the 7th Space War, it was found that certain human beings had mysterious arcane abilities, powers of the mind to control and forsee. These gifted people were called Newtypes. They were valuable to both sides of the war; the Earth Federation designed the Flash System which allowed a Newtype pilot to control a horde of unmanned MS, called Bit-Mobile Suits.This was an effective weapon, but sacrificed the lives of many Newtypes.Space fought back for principal, believing the effect of living in Space heightened every human ability and eventually created the prized power of a Newtype, who was not something to use as a tool for war. But in the end, mankind was its own downfall. During the final battle, the Space Revolution Army (SRA) crashed numerous colonies into the planet Earth, with a devastating effect.Millions died as a result of the colony drop.

The rest that made it through had to endure and suffer with living on a ruined planet, plagued by an endless winter and an ever-changing, chaotic atmosphere. With that, the war had ended. For now. But everyone who continued to live on was possessed by that tragic war, and the word ""Newtype""...The year is After War 0015, and life on Earth is finally on its way to creating a more perfect world, except for the ruthless mercenaries who use mobile suits to make a living raiding; called Vultures, some of these people are merely chasing money, while others are running from the past.

Fanning great gusts of destructive magical wind, it reduced nearly everything to empty wasteland before a knight appeared to challenge it.Bearing a sacred sword and shield which repulsed magic, this knight finally struck the monster down after a tremendous battle. But this creature would not die, and as it lay immobile, the wind poured forth from its wounds unrelentingly. With the last of his strength, the knight planted his sword high atop the mountain where the battle had been fought, so that it would shield a part of the land from the wind. This was the beginning of Gimrey, and the reason why everyone is born with innate magic.As time passed, people began to fight over fertile ground. ELNA SAGA begins right before the outbreak of yet another war, and tells of a princess named Elna. Born without any magic whatsoever and as such being the only person who can actually touch the sacred sword guarding Gimrey, she becomes a pawn used by her kingdom to threaten other countries with destruction. A rival kingdom's assassination attempt turns rescue, however, when the ones behind this plot reveal that they have no qualms about killing Elna as long as they can maintain a facade using a lookalike. With the help of her would-be assassin, who is drawn to her innocence and compassion, Elna journeys to define herself and stop a terrible war that her country has started.The first thing one notices is the richness of the world in which this series has been set. The ideas behind ELNA SAGA are drawn loosely from Nordic culture and mythology and the story, people, and names all bear a medieval Northern European flavor. There are no gods or non-human races, but Valkyries, Berserks, and the world tree Yggdrasil make their appearance in one form or another, and the castles and towns evoke nostalgic memories of old storybooks.",Tsutsumi Shouko,Action|Adventure|Fantasy|Shounen,2016-01-20 13:59,84100.0

Noblesse,/mangaimage/manga-sp951798.jpg,Chapter 545: Epilogue [End],4.79,/manga/manga-sp951798,manga-sp951798,Noblesse,"is of a strong aristocrat - He is beginning to become accustomed to today's world, and has woken up within an abandoned building in South Korea. He goes into a school where he meets with his true servant Frankenstein. Into Ye Ran high school, Rai registers with Frankenstein's help, and unwittingly befriends Shin Woo - an athletic teen, Ik Han - Yuna, a computer geek - some others, and Shin Woo's puppy love. Noblesse follows the frequently dangerous experiences against a secret organization of the group while uncovering Rai's past.Rai is an extremely enchanting, refined, and Distinguished that is cryptic. He's frequently used along with the mistakes he makes with technology, his love of ramen, and his horrible sense of direction as the comic relief of the manhwa. He had woken up within an abandoned building in South Korea, and had fallen right into a heavy slumber for 820 years. After seeing what all the people on the roads were wearing, Rai unwittingly followed the pupils there, and took on the uniform of a pupil from Ye Ran High School, which will be below the management of Frankenstein. He now lives with Frankenstein. He's proven to be exceptionally strong using the power of mind control, as well as a technique called ""Blood Field"". Although he looks apathetic and cool externally, Rai has revealed compassion towards human beings, though it's not understood whether this is as a result of genuine empathy or just a sense of duty.It appears that if his powers are used by Rai widely, his general health and wellbeing deteriorates, as seen following the conflict using the D5, although Rai stated that it was nothing to be concerned about. However, Frankenstein understands that his master needs time to totally regain his strength that is old. Yet, as said by Regis, even in his present state Rai possesses a tremendous power similar or even superior to that of the Lord that is existing. By creating strong blood subjects without using an obvious spirit weapon with perfect kind Rai presents his complete government over blood. An early adviser to Lord, Gejutel, clarifies that Rai's spirit weapon will not materialize as a weapon; soul and Rai's blood is his spirit weapon. So that her spirit weapon Ragnarok can be completed by the present Lord Rai is revealed to have relinquished his possession of Ragnarok. When used Rai's power uses up his life force. When he wakes up, he uses an excellent quantity of electricity, although Frankenstein eventually gets Rai to take a brief hibernation.Frankenstein is Rai's faithful servant. He supports Rai wholeheartedly and calls him ""Master"". He'd attempted hunting for his master after Rai eventually went to find Rai independently and vanished. Frankenstein is the principal/manager of Ye Ran High School, which he made that if Rai should return, Rai could have the ability to live a life that is normal. Frankenstein is hugely powerful. Frankenstein is the sole human to be recognized by the previous Lord because he obtained power and transcended human limits. Afterwards however Rai had sealed away his powers due to misdeeds perpetrated in pursuit of power and scientific knowledge. Frankenstein is a really cheerful man, but becomes computing and serious although during conflicts Frankenstein has revealed a sadistic side, when the situation calls for it. He's incredibly organized and loathes messiness (particularly in his house). Like Rai, he's quite compassionate towards human beings, particularly the pupils in his school. Frankenstein is a remarkable scientist, who has studied human alteration . His research is in charge of a lot of the improvements people created using adjustment. He was quite knowledgeable about the last Lord, whom he calls ""old bugger."" Frankenstein is truly human (CH190); although it hasn't yet been expressly said, it's most likely he tested upon himself to gain the strength which he has now.Shin Woo is a fit and dynamic teen with brilliant red hair. He's obviously seen having a bandage on the bridge of his nose. He's well-known dreaded by gangs and inside the town to be proficient in martial arts. He's at fighting with the top level trained representatives of the Union, those that have not been transformed. He fights with the man that is contaminated and causes very serious damage while getting no substantial damage. Shin Woo is frequently revealed sleep (and drooling) in course and slacking off. Though he's revealed as a lazy student, he also would shield his buddies no matter what and is extremely brave. Shinwoo is proven to be popular among the student body of other school as well as Yeran High because of his exceptional fighting abilities. At start of quantity 4, KSA scouted him to eventually become altered human due to the very rationale. Shinwoo is suggested to have feelings towards Seira, who shows party favor for him.",Son Jae-Ho,Lee Gwang-Su|Action|Comedy|Drama|Mystery|School life|Shounen|Supernatural|Webtoons|Manhwa,2019-01-08 17:36,83400000.0

This has caused a lot of trouble in his life, but now he has learned to fight back against the evil spirits! Unfortunately, he's now also very poor, homeless, and hoping for a happier, more normal, high school life. In his search for housing, he's introduced to a very cheap boarding house called Yuragi-sou, which was formerly a popular hot springs inn. It's so cheap because the house is haunted by the spirit of a high school student whose corpse was found there. Kogarashi doesn't think this is going to be a problem for him, and the rest of the house's tenants appear to be sexy women. While relaxing in the hot springs, though, he finds there is an issue with his ghost-banishing plan; Yuragi-sou's ghost is a 16-year-old girl named Yuna, who lives in his room. Kogarashi has no desire to hurt a ghost girl, and instead he ends up agreeing to help her to figure out her unfinished business. That way, she can move onto the afterlife before turning evil and falling into hell. Once it is clear that he is fine with Yuna, the other tenants reveal their own supernatural secrets--his life in Yuragi-sou is going to be far from ordinary!

It's that vampires emerge in the inlets of the earth, probably followed by age old terrors of the dreary idea to be myth. The world sweeps and maintain it in one blow that is violent, guiding them beneath the surface to security and subjugating the remnants of mankind. This ""protection"" comes in the cost of giving blood for their captors. In the age of twelve, his pal and Yuichiro and fellow orphan Mikaela plotted to escape combined with the kids in Hyakuya Orphanage. Nevertheless, this resulted in their own deaths and be saved by members of the Moon Demon Company, an extermination unit of the Japanese Imperial Demon Army and Mikaela sacrifices himself to escape. Four years after, Yuichiro dedicates his life to destroy vampires and seek revenge against them for killing his ""family"".Yuichiro has medium length black hair which is often looked at dirty and fairly tidy in once.

He also wears the uniform pants and black boots which go on the leggings of the trouser. Yu keeps his sword. Occasionally he could be viewed wearing the JIDA hat, and sometimes wears the JIDA cape at the same time.Yu is somewhat dangerous, fearless and courageous, when he assaulted a Horseman while disregarding orders, that was revealed. It's noted that this was not the first time. People who understand him commonly call Yu an idiot. He's an extremely narrow minded man, whose only aim will be to annihilate all vampires due to what they did to his ""family,"" and he can beat almost any challenge so that you can achieve it. For killing Mika he vowed to exterminate all vampires.Regardless of this, he worries about his buddies first and his goals second and has a soft spot. Ferid Bathory considers this approach to be ""cunning"". Due to this, he empathizes with other people who put their family first, as seen when bogus advice was given his squad by a civilian girl because her family hostage is being held by vampires. After discovering they were deceived by her, he tells the girl that she did the right thing to truly save her family.

After Shinjuku, he makes Guren guarantee to help him take Mika back underneath the assurance that Mika is going to be helpful to him, as he comes from exactly the same orphanage as Yu and becomes nearer to his squad members. Also, bonds and camaraderie be significant to him, as revealed against Asuramaru in a mental conflict, lose his body or to develop more power, he convinces Asuramaru to give to him and calls Asuramaru his buddy.Rather than retribution, his primary target changes to shielding his new ""family,"" so that you can prevent a repeat of previous occasions. In Nagoya, Narumi's squad surprises by swearing to shield them and memorizing all of the names.Likewise to how vampires tend not to trouble to consider human faces and just think of these as ""people"" or ""livestock,"" Yu simply views vampires as ""vampires"" or ""bloodsuckers"" without troubling to recall their names or faces. He doesn't even remember the name of his vampire target.

He's also hunting for his dad who's called the Thousand Master.While initially seeming to be another romantic-comedy work featuring numerous bish?jo characters like Love Hina, the show, has advanced right into a mixture of sh?nen romance, fantasy, horror, action and comedy. Akamatsu said that he particularly wanted to do some thing ""different"" from Love Hina. Negi himself is prepubescent, and several of his scenes with Asuna are unique variations of the ""awkward romantic scene"" trend of harem manga, immediately defused and just played for laughs. Additionally, a lot of the girls are not unable to fawn over him in a childish sense with no expectations that are intimate in the reader [ study that is unique?]In maintaining this particular fashion, Negi himself is considered other typical male leads of manga as well as a comparison to Love Hina's Keitaro Urashima. He's hardworking, competent, and treated kindly, but due to his look and age (well below the majority of his pupils), he feels utterly non-threatening and finds it hard to be taken seriously as a teacher; several of his pupils handle him as a cunning little child, if not a playmate (or plaything)",Akamatsu Ken,Action|Adventure|Comedy|Cooking|Doujinshi|Fantasy|Harem|Martial arts|Romance|School life|Sci fi|Shounen|Supernatural,2022-11-02 12:14,13800000.0

The protagonist is the Leo Gold Saint, Aiolia, who is mistrusted by the rest of the Saints because of the seemingly traitorous actions of his brother Sagittarius Aiolos in the past. In turn, he holds a grudge against the Saints as a whole, and against the elite order of the Gold Saints in particular.    While the Pope, the leader of the Saints, sends Aiolia on mission after mission to prove his loyalty, evil forces manifest that threaten to destroy Sanctuary, the home of the Saints. A modern-day Titanomachy begins as the Titans, ancient gods with a desire for revenge on the Olympian gods, attack Sanctuary to retrieve the ""Megas Drepanon"", the weapon into which Zeus had sealed their King, Kronos, in the age of mythology. Their first assault is thwarted by Aiolia, who subsequently gains the attention of the Titans as the ""man of the evil omen"" who is destined to free their King.

Naruto,/mangaimage/manga-ng952689.jpg,Chapter 700.5 : Uzumaki Naruto,4.48,/manga/manga-ng952689,manga-ng952689,Naruto,"Naruto is a manga series from Japan. It's about the story of a young ninja who wants to become the strongest leader in his village. The series were produced by Masashi Kishimoto and in 1997 were published. Later this manga was adapted into a TV anime. This studio also has developed 10 movies as well as a number of video animations. You can read Naruto manga online, which until today has sold over 220 copies around the world (except from Japan in 35 more countries), making it the 3rd best selling series of manga in history. When he was a child, Naruto was isolated from its community. The people in the village treated him as he was Nine-Tails itself and don't want him. None in the village had the right to mention the Nine-Tails, in order to prevent Naruto from finding the truth. But 12 years later, he finds out the truth from ninja Mizuki, who told him. Some time later, Naruto becomes a ninja and usually competes against other teams, and they form a three-person team by the name Team 7. Like all the other similar teams in every village, the Team 7 has to complete missions that are requested by the villagers, ranging from being bodyguards or doing chores. After participating in a number of missions, the Team 7 is allowed to take place in an exam, in order to move up in hierarchy and be able to be involved in more difficult missions. After 2,5 years, Naruto returns from training and he continued with his team to fight the Akatsuki members.When Kishimoto first made the plot of the story, thought that it was a mess. For example, he thought that the chakras, along with other hand signs made Naruto look like a lot of Japanese them, but he believed that it could be enjoyable for reading. In these particular series, he actually tried to make his characters to look like unique ones. Above all he based his main theme on the Japanese culture and he separated the characters in the series into different teams, in order to give to each team a special flavor. He wanted to make each member to look like an 'extreme' character and when he was creating them, Kishimoto followed the 5 steps, like drafting, sketching, colouring, inking and shading. Moreover, when he started creating the series, Kishimoto paid attention to the designs of the village and the settings. For instance, the village was created spontaneously, but he took the idea for the scenery from his home in Okayama, in Japan.The Naruto Anime made its debut in Japan TV Tokyo in October 2002 and was concluded in 2007 after 220 episodes. In addition, these series led also led to the production of 10 films. The first one under the title 'Ninja clash in the land of Snow' was first released in August 2004 in Japan and told the story fo how Team 7 was sent to the Land of Snow, in order to protect the actors from shootings of he new Princess Fun movie.The soundtracks of '' were composed by T. Masuda. The first under the title 'Naruto Manga Original Soundtrack' was released in April 2003 and had 22 tracks.

It follows a character by the name of Kanoe Zouichi and the mysterious Kanoe Fuyu whose luminous form is integrated into the system of his bike. They are agents sent by a powerful organization to retrieve the human with the ability to resist and transmute the NS5 infection that is spreading across the world, named Yion/Ion Green. However, their mission is delayed by the reckless actions of the Public Health Department's taskforce and the kidnapping of Yion/Ion Green. Will they complete their mission? Where has Yion/Ion Green been taken? These questions will only be answered as more volumes are released. The art in BioMega is similar to BLAME!, with its complicated concrete sprawl and ludicrously wide, empty spaces. However, things seem to happen at a more reasonable pace. In this manga, there is emphasis on the swiftness of the attacks made by Zouichi, such as the gun being sheathed just before the enemies fall to the ground. Speed is crucial in this manga, unlike in BLAME!, and the plot develops just as quickly.

It's a ground-breaking classic, in the sense that it's the very first manga to realistically depict the gay S&M scene. Set in New York in the late 1980s, Partners follows the lives of six close friends who also happen to be leathermen. The manga depicts their relationships -- both sexual and emotional -- with unabashed honesty. While the story practically explodes off the page with a continuous, unremitting and glorious parade of smut, it isn't ""meaningless sex"" -- these are committed couples in full-time relationships, where pleasure and pain are natural expressions of affection for one another. (You guessed it; that's where the manga's name comes from. They're ""partners."")The six friends that star in this manga are split up into three pairs. The main pair consists of Marlon and Doug, around whose relationship the manga revolves. Marlon, a high-flying executive, plays sub and devoted masochist to the beautifully dominant Doug. Doug is, interestingly enough, a janitor at the very company Marlon directs; during the average workday, they barely even make eye-contact. The contrast between their private and public lives is as stark as it is lovely. The other couples also feature in major roles, and what we end up with is an intimate and moving glimpse at an otherwise unconventional lifestyle.Be warned -- these aren't willowy bishounen clasping each other in slender arms! These are very real, very authentic male bodies bending and contorting in well-established ways.
